I made this project because I am really interested in skincare and wanted to combine it with my interest in tech. I made it using CSS, JS, and HTML. I used the Gemini api key. It inputs skincare ingredients and tells you if it's good for your skin
I had to learn how to implement API into my web dev skills :)
